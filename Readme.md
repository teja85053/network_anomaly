## üß† Introduction

This project explores machine learning approaches to detect intrusions in network traffic by analyzing the **KDD Cup dataset**. It evaluates the performance of:
- **XGBoost**: For supervised classification
- **Autoencoders**: For unsupervised anomaly detection
- **GANs**: For modeling normal behavior and identifying deviations

---

## üéØ Motivation

The need for **intelligent, adaptive, and real-time intrusion detection systems** has never been more critical. Traditional systems fail to detect emerging threats and generate many false positives. Machine learning can address these shortcomings by learning patterns in network traffic and adapting to new threats.

## ‚úÖ Results

| Model        | Accuracy (%) | Recall (%) | F1 Score (%) |
|--------------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| XGBoost      | **99.98**    | 99.85      | 99.92        |
| Autoencoder  | 97.45        | 96.92      | 97.18        |
| GAN          | 99.87        | **93.43**  | **93.77**    |

- **XGBoost** is highly effective for supervised tasks with labeled data.
- **Autoencoders** are useful for identifying unknown anomalies via reconstruction loss.
- **GANs** excel at recognizing complex, novel patterns and modeling normal behavior.

## üí° Conclusion

Each model demonstrates unique strengths in network anomaly detection:
- **XGBoost**: Best for high-accuracy classification of known attacks.
- **Autoencoders**: Ideal for discovering new threats without labeled data.
- **GANs**: Combines generative modeling and detection for robust, adaptive systems.

The combination or ensemble of these models can lead to an **advanced intrusion detection system** capable of handling diverse cyber threats.
